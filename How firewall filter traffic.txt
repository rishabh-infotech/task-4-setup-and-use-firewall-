1. rule based inspection : Firewall have inbound and outbound rules organised into an access control list. according to rules, it take decision.

2. packet examination : when data packets arrives, the firewall inspects its header, because header stores metadata.

3. Rule matching : the firewall compares the packet's information against its rule set. it check rule set from top to bottom.

4. decision making : The first rule that match with packet header information, decides firewall action.

5. default action :  If packet does not match any rule them firewall apply default action which is deny or drop that packet
